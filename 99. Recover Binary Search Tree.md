# 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

![ba4186b2aae7a1d13701cfb426cdf03](https://github.com/WANG-ZIHENG/Leetcode/assets/118211037/fe0db3da-d438-453b-94d2-2a2906ca723d)

According to the features of the binary search tree, arbitrary  node:

* all nodes' values of its left subtree are less than its value
* all nodes' values of its right subtree are greater than its value

the **inorder traversal** is helpful, because inorder traversal visits order that is firstly the left node, secondly the root node, and finally the right node. Thus, the visited order must be ascending. 

Taking an example from the above picture (the right tree recovered):
 * The root node is 3, then find left node 1 of 3. Inorder traversal visits **1** because of no left node of 1, followed by visiting the right node **2**  of 3 due to no left node of 2.
 * After all left subtree nodes, inoder traversal visits the root node **3** before traversal ends because no any right node of 3.
 
The bold font is the inorder traversal order, obviously it is ascending.

### Let's start solving the problem:

1. Utilizing inorder traversal to get visiting order of the whole tree.
2. Comparing sorted order with original order, then exchange different components' values with each other.
3. Returning 

```python
class Solution(object):
    def recoverTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        in_order = []
        def inOrder(node):
            if node is None:
                return None
            inOrder(node.left)
            in_order.append(node)
            inOrder(node.right)
        inOrder(root)
        sorted_order = sorted(in_order, key = lambda x: x.val)
        for i in range(len(in_order)):
            if in_order[i] != sorted_order[i]:
                in_order[i].val, sorted_order[i].val = sorted_order[i].val, in_order[i].val
                return 
```

The list `in_order` stores nodes, and `sorted_order` sorts nodes by their values. When differences are found, two nodes exchange their values.



Hope it helps.
