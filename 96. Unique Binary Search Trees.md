```
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
```

First of all, the trait of binary search tree:

* Arbitrary nodes of the left subtree is less than the root node.
* Arbitrary nodes of the right subtree is greater than the root node.



### First solution:

Suppose **i** is the root in a tree of **n** nodes.

**1 ~ i-1** is the left subtree, and **i+1 ~ n** is the right subtree.

So the number of left subtree's nodes: `left = i - 1`, 

the number of right subtree's nodes: `right = n - i`.



Below I have `num[n]` representing the number of unique binary search trees with **n** nodes.

When **n** known, all nodes from **1** to **n**  can be as the root node **i**. Thus `num[n]` is equal to the sum of the products of the number of left subtree structures and the number of right subtree structures of all root nodes **i**.

```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
    	# Whatever the number of nodes are 0 or 1
    	# the structure is unique, thus return 1
        if n == 0 or n ==1:
            return 1
        # create a list, initialize values are 0
        num = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
        num[0] = num[1] = 1
        
        # the number from 2 to n
        for number in range(2,n+1):
        
        	# The number of known nodes, with different points as root nodes
            for root in range(1, number+1):
            
                left = root - 1 # the number of nodes of left subtree
                right = number - root  # the number of nodes of right subtree
                
                # num[number] accumulate each root node's
          		# all structure of left subtree * all structure of right subtree
                num[number] += num[left]*num[right]
                
        return num[n]
```



### Second solution:

Introduce [Catalan number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number).

Let me draw a picture to show the situation of **n = 1, 2, 3**.

![96](https://github.com/WANG-ZIHENG/Leetcode/assets/118211037/75e171fe-ed66-4d75-8f88-411621f4006f)

Below I use `dp[i]` describes binary search tree consists of the number of **i** nodes.

`dp[0] = dp[1] = 1`

`dp[2] = dp[0] * dp[1]` **1** is the root. There is no left subtree and the right subtree has a number.

​			`+ dp[1] * dp[0]` **2** is the root. There is no right subtree and the left subtree has a number.

In the same way, the calculation method of `n = 3` can be written.

`dp[3] = dp[0] * dp[2]` **1** is the root. There is no left subtree and the right subtree has two numbers.

​		    `+ dp[1] * dp[1]` **2** is the root. The left subtree has a number and the right subtree has a number.

​	        `+ dp[2] * dp[0]` **3** is the root. There is no right subtree and the left subtree has two numbers.

The Catalan numbers satisfy the recurrence relations:

![10a71da890440610b5d8a840b29db29](https://github.com/WANG-ZIHENG/Leetcode/assets/118211037/14cf958f-67f6-44a5-b318-cb04de5644c0)


According above analysis:

```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0 or n ==1:
            return 1
        dp = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1
        
        for i in range(2,n+1):
            for j in range(0,i):
            	# based on above recurrence relations
                dp[i] += dp[j]*dp[i-j-1]
                
        return dp[n]
```



### Third solution:

Meanwhile, The $n_{th}$ Catalan number can be expressed directly in terms of the central binomial coefficients by 

​                                                           $\huge C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)! n!}$

Simplification:

​                                                          $\huge C_n = \frac{(2n*(2n-1)*...*(n+1))}{(n+1)!}$

```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n):
        if n == 0 or n==1:
            return 1
        ans = i = 1
        while i <= n:
        	# The denominator is from n+1 to 2n, and numerator is from 1 to n.
        	# The denominator is the same, the numerator is missing (n+1).
            ans = ans*(i+n)/i
            i += 1
        # After the loop ends i = n+1
        # Returns the answer divided by n+1 where the numerator is missing 
        return int(ans/i)
```

Compared with first and second code block, the third code directly utilize the Catalan number. The advantages of third solution:

* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$

The other two:

* Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
* Space complexity: $O(n)$



Using the third method directly is not conducive to understanding the nature of the problem. It is recommended to start with the first and second methods, and use the third method after fully understanding. Hope this article helps.
