# 1232. Check If It Is a Straight Line

This is an easy question, but I want to introduce the important significance of **the general equation of straight line**.

The representation of the straight line equation has:

* the general form
* the point-slope form
* the intercept form
* the slope-intercept form
* the two-point form and so on

In addition to **the general equation**, they either cannot support straight lines in all cases (such as perpendicular or parallel to the coordinate axis), or cannot support points in all cases (such as equal x coordinates, or equal y coordinates). Therefore, general formula equations are especially useful when processing two-dimensional graphic data with a computer.

More details to explain:

â€‹	For example, I use the slope-intercept form to resolve this problem. If the line parallel to x-axis or y-axis, the slope is incalculable.



### Finding the general equation of a straight line with two points on the known straight line:

It is known that there are two points **point1(x1,y1)**, **point2(x2,y2)** on the straight line, and the two points **point1** and **point2** do not coincide. Then in the general equation $Ax + By +C = 0$ of the straight line, $A, B, C$ are respectively equal to:
$$A = y2 - y1$$
$$B = x1 - x2$$
$$C = x2*y1 - x1*y2$$

```python
class Solution(object):
    def checkStraightLine(self, coordinates):
        """
        :type coordinates: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        #  the most general equation for a straight line
        #  A*x + B*y + C = 0
        #  A = (y2 - y1)
        #  B = (x1 - x2)
        #  C = x2*y1 - x1*y2
        point1,point2 = coordinates[0],coordinates[1]
        x1,y1 = point1
        x2,y2 = point2
        A = (y2 - y1)
        B = (x1 - x2)
        C = x2*y1 - x1*y2

        for (x,y) in coordinates[2:]:
            if A*x + B*y + C != 0:
                return False
        return True
```

 Hope it hopes.
