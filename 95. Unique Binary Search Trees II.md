# 95. Unique Binary Search Trees II

Description: Given an integer `n`, return *all the structurally unique **BST'**s (binary search trees), which has exactly* `n` *nodes of unique values from* `1` *to* `n`. Return the answer in **any order**.

```
Input: n = 3
Output: [[1,null,2,null,3],[1,null,3,2],[2,1,3],[3,1,null,null,2],[3,2,null,1]]
```

### Definition:

* If the left subtree of any node is not empty, the value of all nodes on the left subtree is less than the value of its root node.
* If the right subtree of any node is not empty, the value of all nodes on the right subtree is greater than the value of its root node.
* The left and right subtrees of arbitrary node are also binary search trees
* There are no nodes with equal values.

### Approach: 

* Recursion
* Recursion and Dynamic Programming 

Dynamic Programming optimizes recursion approach.

### ideals:

* Select a node in turn as the root each time in the range.

* After one node selected as the root, the tree is divided into left and right subtrees until both subtrees of the root node are empty.

* Every nodes of left subtree can be root node of subtree, thus there are several kinds of left subtrees. Same for right tree.

  According to above image, **1** is selected as root, both of **2** and **3** can be the root node of right subtree of **1**.

* The left and right subtrees are then paired with each other (each left subtree matches all right subtrees and each right subtree matches all left subtrees). Then insert the two subtrees at the root node.

* Finally, put root node into the result list.



#### Precondition:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

#### Solution:

##### Recursion:

```python
class Solution:
   def generateTrees(self, n: 'int') -> 'List[TreeNode]':
        # Decorators
        # Utilize generate function produce subtrees.
        def generate(left, right):
        
            # Recursive boundary condition
            if left > right:
                return [None]

            result = []
            
            # Selcet i as the root
            for i in range(left, right+1):
            
                # recursively generate the left and right subtrees
                # ensure any node's value of lsubtrees less than root's value
                # ensure any node's value of rsubtrees greater than root's value
                lsubtrees = generate(left, i-1)
                rsubtrees = generate(i+1, right)

                # The left and right subtrees are then paired with each other
                for l in lsubtrees:
                    for r in rsubtrees:
                        root = TreeNode(i)
                        root.left = l
                        root.right = r
                        # put root node into the result list
                        result.append(root)
                # When this cycle of loop ends,
                # all possible left and right subtrees with i as the root node
                # have been stored in the rusult list.
            
            return result
        return generate(1,n)   # return and call the decorator function
```

The above code block is a recursive solution to this problem. It is effective, but still can be optimized by **dynamic programming**.

Introduce a dictionary `sub = {}` to store subtree.

Take `generate(1, 3)` as an example to explain:

​	Suppose **i = 4** is the root node now.

​	`lsubtrees = generate(left, i-1)`  is `lsubtrees = generate(1, 3)`

​	After recursion, got all possible `lsubtrees` (left subtrees), as below image. And utilize `sub[(left,right)] = result` to store (`sub[(1,3)] = result`).

​	

​	Then when **i = 5** is the root node, the first recursion of `lsubtrees` is `generate(1,4)`. There must be `lsubtrees = generate(1,3)` in the subsequent recursion of `generate(1,4)`. If program repeating to calculate `lsubtrees = generate(1,3)` is a **waste**, program can get directly result of  `generate(1,3)` from dictionary `sub`.

##### Recursion and Dynamic programming:

```python
class Solution:
   def generateTrees(self, n: 'int') -> 'List[TreeNode]':
        # subtrees structure storage
        sub = {}
   
        # Decorators
        # Utilize generate function produce subtrees.
        def generate(left, right):
        
            # Recursive boundary condition
            if left > right:
                return [None]
                
            # directly get existing subtrees structure
            if (left, right) in sub:
                return sub[(left, right)]

            result = []
            
            # Selcet i as the root
            for i in range(left, right+1):
            
                # recursively generate the left and right subtrees
                # ensure any node's value of lsubtrees less than root's value
                # ensure any node's value of rsubtrees greater than root's value
                lsubtrees = generate(left, i-1)
                rsubtrees = generate(i+1, right)

                # The left and right subtrees are then paired with each other
                for l in lsubtrees:
                    for r in rsubtrees:
                        root = TreeNode(i)
                        root.left = l
                        root.right = r
                        # put root node into the result list
                        result.append(root)
                # When this cycle of loop ends,
                # all possible left and right subtrees with i as the root node
                # have been stored in the rusult list.
            
            # store the existing subtree structure
            sub[(left, right)] = result
            
            return result
        return generate(1,n)   # return and call the decorator function
```

The above is my solution to the **Unique Binary Search Trees II** problem, hope it helps.
